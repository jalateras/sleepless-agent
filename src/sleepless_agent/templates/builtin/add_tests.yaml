  Create comprehensive unit tests for the following file:

  Target: {target}
  Coverage focus: {coverage}

  Requirements:
  - Use the project's existing test framework (detect from existing tests)
  - Cover happy paths and edge cases
  - Include docstrings explaining each test
  - Follow existing test naming conventions
  - Place tests in the appropriate test directory
  - Mock external dependencies appropriately
  - Aim for high coverage of the target code

  If test files already exist for this module, extend them rather than creating duplicates.
