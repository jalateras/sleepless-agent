# Project Orchestrator Configuration
#
# This file defines projects that the sleepless-agent will monitor and
# generate tasks for. Each project can have:
# - A local workspace path
# - Optional GitHub integration
# - Goals that guide task generation
# - Constraints on what work should NOT be done
#
# Copy this file to data/projects.yaml and customize for your projects.

  # Example 3: Local-only project (no GitHub integration)
  # - id: side-project
  #   name: "Side Project"
  #   local_path: /Users/jima/projects/side-project
  #   goals:
  #     - type: feature
  #       description: "MVP implementation"

# Notes:
#
# Project Goal Types:
# - coverage: Target code coverage percentage
# - documentation: Improve documentation in specified areas
# - performance: Improve performance metric
# - feature: Implement a specific feature
# - testing: Add or improve tests
#
# Priority Levels:
# - low: Background work, only when idle
# - medium: Standard priority
# - high: Important project, check frequently
# - urgent: Critical project, prioritize above all else
#
# Sync Modes:
# - pull: Pull changes from GitHub before analysis
